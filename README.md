![Notebook](my_project.com)
I did a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing thousands of apps in the Google Play store. Using Python libraries Pandas and Plotly, I analyzed the app market with the goal of answering the questions, which apps have the highest downloads, what categories of apps are most downloaded, what is the revenue potential for a paid app, which categories and content type for paid apps make them sell?. The overall goal is to develop an app pricing mechanism to make data-informed decisions in pricing and categorizing new apps to ensure their success in the Android app market.
