## Some Recent Open Projects:

### 1. Google Play Store App Analytics.
In this project, I did a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing thousands of apps in the Google Play store. Using Python libraries Pandas and Plotly, I analyzed the app market with the goal of answering the questions:
- which apps have the highest downloads?
- what categories of apps are most downloaded?
- what is the revenue potential for a paid app?
- which categories and content type for paid apps make them sell?
The overall goal is to develop an app pricing mechanism to make data-informed decisions in pricing and categorizing new apps to ensure their success in the Android app market.

### 2. Formula 1 Sport Historical Data Analytics Project (Data Engineering and Analytics).
In this project, I analysed the Ergast Formula1 sports database to understand the dominant drivers and dominant teams since the history of the sports. Doing this Data Engineering project enabled me to get proficient with Spark, Databricks, Azure Data Factory and refresh my SQL skill. 
- I used Databricks, Pyspark and SparkSQL in Microsoft Azure environment for the project.
- I wrote Pyspark and SparkSQL scripts to ingest all the data into Azure Datalake Storage Gen2(ADLS) with both full load and incremental loading approaches.
- I wrote Pyspark and SparkSQL transformation scripts to analyse the raw data to gain understanding into most dominant drivers and teams through time.
- I create live Databricks dashboard on top of the SQL analysis workflows for visualization.
- I created three pipelines in the Microsoft Azure Data Factory to automate the data ingestion and transformation processes. 
- I setup triggers in the Data Factory to execute the notebook at scheduled times.
- Some of data ingestion and transformation notebooks are here attached.

### 3. House Price Prediction project (Data Science & Machine Learning):
In this project, I used Python libraries Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to analyze the Boston city house pricing dataset.
- I started with exploratory data analysis.
- Built a regression model to help predict the prices of new homes.
- Used log transform to improve the distribution of the dataset.
- Built the model again which is able to predict with 79% accuracy.

### 4. Population Dashboard project (GeoData Analytics & Automation):
In this project, working together in a team of three to produce 3 different dashboards, 
- I used Python to scrape Baden-Wurttemberg population and migration statistic data,
- I used Python to grap OpenStreetMap geo data for Stuttgart City(includes land use data and building footprints).
- Data cleaning and transformation were performed.
- PostgreSQL database was designed to store data.
- The data was analyzed in ArcGIS Pro GIS desktop software,
- A live dashboard was created to visualize the patterns in the data.
- A regression model was used to learn the pattern of population growth and to project the population of Stuttgart City and the Stuttgart administrative area by 2040.
- The workflow was automated to enable any update on the Baden-Wuerttemberg Statistic [**site**](https://www.statistik-bw.de/) to reflect in the dashboard. 
A short video on the project can be seen here. [**Video**](https://youtu.be/H-GCY9xvKJI).

### 5. Clothings Image Classification Project (Deep learning).
Using TensorFlow Deep Learning library and Python, I built neural network image classification models in attempt to classify images of different items of clothings.

- No. of unique classes to classify 10
- Training data : 60,000 images
- Testing data : 10,000 images
- Image Size: 28x28 grayscale images.
- Dataset Source: Tensorflow Fashion MNIST dataset.
  
Brief Summary: I built 3 different neural network classification models and compared their accuracy on the testing data. The best performing model achieved an accurary of 80%. Through the confusion matrix computed, it was observed that images of few classes such as T-shirt and Pullover were the most misclassified since their images tend to look quite familiar.

### 6. Food Images Classification project (Deep Learning with Transfer Learning).
In this project, I build CNN models to classify 10 classes of food. The best results achieved was 41% validation accuracy from three CNN models I built from scratch, even after augmenting the data. So I used Transfer learning feature extraction, where I used Resnet50 and EfficientnetB0 architectures to improve the classification to finally realise a validation accuracy of 91% without overfitting.
Dataset include: 10 classes of food extracted from the Food101 Kaggle dataset.
